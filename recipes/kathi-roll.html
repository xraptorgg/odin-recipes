        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A kati roll is a street-food dish originating from Kolkata, West Bengal. In its original form, it is a skewer-roasted kebab wrapped in a paratha bread, although over the years many variants have evolved all of which now go under the generic name of kati roll. Today, mostly any wrap containing a filling enfolded in an Indian flatbread (roti) is called a kati roll. In native Bengali, the word Kati roughly translates to "Stick", referring to how they were originally made. In Bengal though, the delicacy is simply known as "roll". Kati Rolls normally contain coriander chutney, egg, and chicken but the types may vary. Internationally, specifically in parts of Canada and the United States, kathi roll has become popular fast food found in Indian take-out restaurants.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the marinade ingredients and stir well. Add chicken and toss well in the marinade. Refrigerate while you prep and saute other ingredients, about 15-20 minutes. You can marinate the chicken anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Toss thinly sliced onions with salt, red chili and lime juice and set aside for later.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide skillet or pan, on medium-high heat. Add sliced onions and peppers and saute for 3 minutes, until they begin to soften a bit.</li>
            <li>Add marinated chicken and stir well. Cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring at regular intervals, until the chicken cooks through. Turn off the heat and stir in chopped cilantro.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan on medium-high heat. If making frozen Indian paratha, cook according to package instructions. For tortilla, drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil and place the tortilla in the pan. Using a spatula, keep rotating the wrap and cook for 2 minutes on the first side until light brown. Flip to cook on the other side for another 1.5-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread about a tablespoon of the egg mixture on the browned side, flip and cook for 30 seconds, or until the egg cooks through.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 tablespoon (or less) of green chutney on the cooked wrap. Add about 0.5 cup of chicken filling across the middle. Top with pickled onions and cilantro.</li>
            <li>Starting from the side parallel to the filling, roll the paratha or tortilla all the way. Wrap in aluminum foil halfway or insert toothpicks to hold the wrap in place.</li>
        </ol>
